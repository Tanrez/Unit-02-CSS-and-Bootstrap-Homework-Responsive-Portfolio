On every page I have a blue navbar with 3 links redirecting you to different parts of my Portfolio.

On the About page(index.html) I have biography about me and 4 img elements. I also put more info into a card on the right of the page.

On my portfolio page(portfolio.html) I have a card that links to my first homework assignment with a small description on it and a button.
